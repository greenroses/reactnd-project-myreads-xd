# MyReads: A Bookshelf App
React app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. 

## Installation
Install packages: 'npm install'
Launch webpage: 'npm start'
Unless modified, the webpage will use port 3000

## Functionality
The main page displays a list of shelves, each of which contains a number of books. Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.  

## Contribution
The project is the first project of the Udacity React Nanodegree. The starter template and backend API server are provided by Udacity.
